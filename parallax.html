  <p>Tokyo, historically Tokio and officially the Tokyo Metropolis (東京都, Tōkyō-to), is the capital and largest city of Japan. Its metropolitan area is the most populous in the world, with an estimated 37.468 million residents in 2018. Located at the head of Tokyo Bay, the prefecture forms part of the Kantō region on the central Pacific coast of Japan's main island of Honshu. Tokyo is the political and economic center of the country, as well as the seat of the Emperor of Japan and the national government. As of 2021, the prefecture has an estimated population of 14.04 million.Originally a fishing village, named Edo, the city became a prominent political center in 1603, when it became the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo was one of the most populous cities in the world at over one million. Following the end of the shogunate in 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to the city, which was renamed Tokyo (literally "eastern capital"). Tokyo was devastated by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, and again by Allied bombing raids during World War II. Beginning in the 1950s, the city underwent rapid reconstruction and expansion, going on to lead Japan's post-war economic recovery. Since 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's 23 special wards (formerly Tokyo City), various bed towns and suburbs in the western area, and two outlying island chains. </p>

  <p>In the Asakusa district of Tokyo, the exquisite Sensō-ji Temple (Kinryū-zan Sensō-ji)) – the city's most famous shrine – stands at the end of a long street market hosting vendors selling masks, carvings, combs made of ebony and wood, toys, kimonos, fabrics, and precious paper goods. Dedicated to Kannon, the Buddhist goddess of compassion, the temple was established in AD 645 and retains its original appearance despite having been rebuilt numerous times. Highlights of a visit include seeing the Kaminari-mon Gate with its 3.3-meter-high red paper lantern bearing the inscription "Thunder Gate," as well as the famous and much-loved Incense Vat, reputed to drive away ailments (you'll see people cupping their hands around the smoke and applying it to the part of their body needing healing). Also of note are the fascinating temple doves, said to be Kannon's sacred messengers. Be sure to drop a coin in the Omikuji boxes near the entrance, from which you can retrieve a piece of paper that will tell your fortune. Afterwards, be sure to explore the rest of the 50-acre temple precinct with its warren of lanes. If you can, revisit the temple again at night for a completely different (and far less crowded) illuminated experience.</p>

  <p>Tokyo can seem electrifying enough during the day, with its constant controlled chaos and endless entertainment. But at night, Japan’s capital takes it to another level. It becomes a neon jungle where light and colour seem to fill every available space. Tokyo is one of those places where residents treat the city as an extension of their homes. It’s just as common to eat at a restaurant as to cook in your own kitchen; amusement parlours provide entertainment after work; small traditional bars are full of friends catching up; cafes offer places to nap; and the streets are just generally busy with people acting busy.For visitors to Tokyo, this is one of the things that makes the city so exciting. But it can also make it terrifyingly confusing. Where do you start when there is just a panoramic roar of sensory overload?! The good news is that you can probably start anywhere and have a great time. When it comes to nightlife in Tokyo, there’s something happening everywhere and it’s all pretty safe.</p>
